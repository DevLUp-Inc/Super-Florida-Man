# Super-Florida-Man

3D Platformer/Collectathon developed by UFGDA!

## Getting Started

### Trello
The invite link is a pinned message in the [#super-florida-man](https://discord.com/channels/521957275204845578/887105285653680130/888503562403987506) channel of the Discord.

Note: The link will only work if you are in the UF Game Dev Association Discord server.

### Unreal Engine v4.27
Unreal Engine can be installed through the Epic Games Launcher or the [installer here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)

### Cloning the Repository

Make sure you have a Git client installed.
This can be the command line through Git Bash or a Git GUI like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

This following section will assume that you have Github Desktop installed, but the process is the same regardless of which client you use.

1. Open Github Desktop and sign in if needed.
2. Go to File -> Clone Repository
3. In the window that pops up, go to URL and use the following link: `https://github.com/UFGDA/Super-Florida-Man`

You now have the repository on your computer and you can now use Unreal to open the project.
